ExtraCells
==========

A mighty Add-On for Applied Energistics

To build this... It's pretty cool:
Download the project (ZIP or fork or whatever) and execute the following in the directory of the Project:

"gradlew setupCIWorkspace build"

this will build it into the build folder :P 

Thanks to arbrarsyed for gmcp :D
